# Decision Patterns
Decision patterns are a cluster of decisions that address a relatively specific issue and can be re-applied in whole or part when that issue is addressed in a different context. Decision patterns allow the decision makers to leverage previous work in developing criteria and alternatives and can be modified by adding to or removing the initial criteria and/or alternatives and adjusting the weighting of the criteria.
