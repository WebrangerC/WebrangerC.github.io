# Coherent Decision Solutions
**(Structured Decision Management, Systems Engineering and the Productivity through Knowledge Management that results)**

## **Vision**
**Structured Decision Management:** Individuals, groups, teams and organizations apply transparent, scalable, structured method for making and implementing impactful decisions. The captured, reusable decisions are a resource for storing and leveraging personal and corporate knowledge to accelerate consensus building, increase reuse and spend more time on the issues that matter. 
**Systems Engineering:** The role of systems engineering in the process of problem solving and product and process development and deployment is recognized as a focused problem solving and development resource, not necessarily an all-encompassing single solution.

## **Mission**
**Structured Decision Management:** Provide a simple, scaleable, structured method for individual and group decision making, capture, organization and reuse available to everyone, via affordable training and tools. Provide a simple ‘on-ramp’ for individuals and a scaleable solution for companies looking to begin their journey with decision management and systems engineering.  
**Systems Engineering:** Musings and examples from my years applying systems thinking and problem solving methods to systems projects  
**Productivity/Knowledge Management**: Unite the ideas from structured decision management and systems engineering enhance the effectiveness of individuals and groups.

I help individuals and groups apply repeatable decision making techniques and tools to manage strategic decisions over time. These Structure Decision Management/Risk Management (SDMRM) techniques are meant to be transferred to the users for their continued independent application.

Individuals, groups or teams can improve the critical decisions they make and enhance the quality of outcomes while decreasing cycle time. An individual can be attempting to choose a college or location to live. A team can track the decisions made from product inception through concept, decision, manufacturing and release. The methods are trainable, repeatable and scalable.

I am currently developing a web-based client/server decision management tool using the Meteor framework (javascript/MongoDB) with React to demonstrate the decision management and its integration in the design process.  If working on an open-source project is interesting to you, please contact me.

## Background

My longest experience was as part of a relatively small engineering organization in an “independent” division of a large corporation. This provided involvement with corporate initiatives in software and systems and access to corporate tools and training but with budget and resource constraints when implementing in the smaller company.
