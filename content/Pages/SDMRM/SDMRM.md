# Structured Decision Management / Risk Management (SDMRM)

Decisions are a primary engineering deliverable. 
There are decisions everywhere, from setting the scope of work to determining the way to test the product or process to be delivered. The decisions create constraints and associated risks for downstream activities. These decisions **ARE** the knowledge base for the project/product. Making these decisions and being able to revisit them as needed is critical.

SDMRM is a method for decision management that enables innovation and collaboration while increasing the speed and quality of decision making and accelerates learning through decision cycles. Better decisions reduce rework and propagate successes thereby leveraging resources for greater accomplishments. 

SDMRM encompasses:

1. a structured process for making a decision  [[Decision-making_basics]]
2. the recognition that one decision impacts other decisions [[Decision Networks]]
3. the oversight of a decision network  [[Decision Administration]]
4. the reuse of decision networks as patterns of use  [[Decision Patterns]]

At CDS, the focus is on the development of capabilities for individual and groups for decision-making, developing and administrating Decision Networks and applying Decision Patterns from the fuzzy front end of a project (large or small) through the product's lifetime.

Coherent Decision Solutions recognizes and promotes the awareness and application of the four tenets shown above as applied by an individual, a group or an organization. CDS also recognizes that the result of decisions can impact other processes and disciplines and endeavors to integrate appropriately with these affiliates.
