# Tools

Since my ‘semi-retirement’, I’ve been (too slowly) working on tools to support S2(DM) . My first pass was a spreadsheet version which supported simple decision making, but not collaborative Decision Making or Decision Management. The Open Decision Tool (odt), while currently a proof-of-concept, is a SaaS platform providing access to decision patterns and supporting the challenge of managing decisions, their driving requirements and the risks associated with delivering solutions.
