Clicking on the project box will take you to the 'Projects' section. The 'User' drop-down navigates to your 'Profile', this 'Help' page, 'About' ODT and 'Logout'.

## **Decision List Page**

This is the main page of ODT. It displays the decisions associated with the selected project. If no project is selected, go to your projects page and select a default and active project.

Decisions are added by providing a name and description and hitting the add button. The decision will be added to the list.
