# Welcome to Coherent Decision Solutions

I’m here to provide some techniques and tools to support decision making, innovation and development processes. Not surprisingly, these activities are related although each also stands on its own. I’ve made some progress on a decision management tool demonstration. Take a look at the Tools page for more info.

My introduction to decision management was in an engineering context. Engineering is about making good decisions based on the requirements of the problem and the constraints of the environment. There are lots of ‘hard parts’ to doing engineering successfully, but in essence, it is about having data and understanding requirements and constraints. I have also found that this is true for life in general.

The framework for decision management that I support can be applied consistently across a number of domains. While the framework is not complex, its successful application is commensurate with the complexity of the goal, as the complications of data acquisition and interactions between decisions impact the effort. *

My goal is to provide training for techniques and tools that support structured decision making/decision management in life, innovation and development processes. Not surprisingly, these activities can be related through our decision management framework.
