# Decision Administration
Decision administration is the project management and quality control of the decision management process. It develops a [[Decision Breakdown Structure]], coordinates the sequencing of decision making, coordinates data gathering (experimentation, research, etc), assures the appropriate level of completeness of each decision and coordinates the interaction between decisions.

In addition, where the situations warrants, decision administration highlights the ‘owner’ of a decision so that the executing authority is visible and accountable. This comes up as more people, departments or organizations are involved in the decision making process.
