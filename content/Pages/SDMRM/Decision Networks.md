# Decision Networks

Decisions seldom exist in isolation. Sometimes there is a hierarchy or a sequence. Often it is even more complicated with one decision being impacted by a number of others and then impacting an additional number. The generic representation for this information is a network or graph which allows us to visualize the interactions and recognize the sequencing for our decision making and its impact.
